## why is this so hard aaaaaa
so now this is what we did and this are the issues we faced 
forgot to add the dependency of postgreSQL in the pom.xml file remember to do that next time
creating the model
-> inclue @Table() and give the name @Version and include the version 
-> include getters and setters for all the elements and include two constructor default and parameterized(no need of id if auto @GenerationValue is provided)
-> if you going to give custom id then you have to give custom version as well

creating the repo
-> you are creating a interface that extends to JpaRepository<modelname,Long> Long for id so here to Long if id is String then String ok va

creating the service
-> didnt face much problem here till now

creating the controller
-> didnt face much probelm here till now

docker
1.docker exec -it <container-name> bash -> to open in bash 
2.psql -U user -> to open as user

well why when we create a container we specify POSTGRES_DB=something, if we havent provide this it uses the username to create one
if you want to create a new database then enter the container using the first command then type the second command
\l -> to list all the everything
\d -> to list  database 
\c database_name -> to enter the database
\dt -> list the schema of database and tables
\du -> get the permissions of the curecnt user that is -U (user) -> this guys
CREATE DATABASE name(;)-> I forgot this and was confused for 20 min ðŸ¥²
