## Theory
Spring security 

there the controllers used in the spring are part of servelets 
so what are servelets are used to handel the request and response for the client and server

so there is something called as front controller with is a dispatcher so what does this thing do well it dispatches the request to appropiate handlers 

then there are spring security filter they are like middleware we can customize them and add few to check and to perform RBA
yeah

so in properties you can set you username and password why? just for development purpose well not same as indivudual ones 
spring.security.user.name and spring.security.user.password

CSRF -> handled by spring boot what is it? it si Cross Site Request Forgiery

well we can handle this
