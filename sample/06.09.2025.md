## Security aaaaaa

so security config allows you to configure the things 

@Configuration 
@EnableWebSecurity 

this two indicate that your class is something that spring security should notice and follow 

there are multiple filters ok so each filter can be customized for now lets remove all of them using 
@Bean
	public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		return http
				.csrf(customizer->customizer.disable())
				.authorizeHttpRequests(auth->auth.anyRequest().authenticated())
				.httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults())
				.build();
	}

see it uses SecurityFilterChain and takes the HttpSecurity as parameter and we return
                .authorizeHttpRequests(auth->auth.anyRequest().authenticated())
				.httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults())
                .build()
so we can change everything is class and interface so refer docs ok

the below is another filter note in top 👆 we say to change the filter but in bottom 👇 we provide custom 
@Bean
	public UserDetailsService addUsersFromMemory() {
		UserDetails user1=User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder().username("goku").password("1234").build();
		return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user1);
	}

the UserDetailService is a interface and InMemoryUserDetailsManager is class that implements and it takes UserDetails object 😵‍💫

no lets provide a AuthenticationProvider that will authenticate the users stored in the database
