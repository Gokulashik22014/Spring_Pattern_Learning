## Security is hard
i just removed all the new custom things I addedd
so use have UserDetailsService that you know says what users are allowed in the application

you can use InMemory to return a set of users who are allowed to login to your account 

but if you want to use database to allow we need to have a custome handler that checks and does 

well we are working on this for long and it is not working i dont know why I am trying to work but no progress yet
