so what we learnt today 
## mvn commands
mvn validate -> check the configuration and the dependencies
mvn compile -> comiple and create the target folder include all the information needed to create the artifact
mvn package -> uses the target folder to create the artifact which is a jar file
mvn install -> install that jar
mvn deploy -> deploy that one
mvn test -> run the test cases

all these are used in the devops to be specific in jenkins automation 

mvn spring-boot:run -> run the spring boot locally in local host default server port 8080
server.ports in application.properties to custom port useful if jenkins is running in port 8080

## annotations 
so many why

@Controller -> to define the controller 
@RestController -> just a alias with some additional features specifically to handle the rest api
@RequestMapping(value="endpoint",method=RequestMethod.GET|so on) -> well self explainatory
@GetMapping("/endpoint") -> guess what we disect and make it simple 
@Component -> for specifying it as the bean
@Service("name") -> alias for Component just convension 
@Qualifier("name") -> used for dependency injection like we specify which service to use i mean which character to use @Qualifier("Hero")

## dependency injection
what lets say this anime -> Hero
well the above says anime is dependent on Hero well lets is it true? no right it depends on characters cause We can change Hero to villian or comedian la 
so anime -> Character makes sense now create concerete class Hero, Villian using the interface Character(FYI Character is a interface best practice you know why)
no you can just use Character interface type similar to List and pass using constructor, setter etc injection

## Ioc 
Inversion of control 
instead of you creating using new
let spring boot take care of it how?
use @Component use the ApplicationContext
we can use @Serivce just a alias with some features now @Service("name")
its getting bit condfusing we


interface -> to make rules for the conceret class 
controller -> use @Qualifier("name") to inject used in Constructort Injection
concerte class -> @Service("name")
