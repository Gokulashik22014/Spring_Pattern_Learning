## JPA
java persistence API what is this why we use this

first lets see Hibernate what is it, it is a ORM(Object relation mapping)
why we even use this lets say we use the traditional JDBC connection we setup connection we write boilder plate code its just long annoying stuff with ORM we map it instead of SELECT * FROM <table> we use table.findAll()

where does JPA come here well we have Objects which has to be mapped to DB well this is handled by JPA we use different annotations such as 
@Entity -> marks class as table
@Id -> Primary key
@GeneratedValue → Auto-increment primary key.
@Column → Customize column name, type, etc.
@OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany → Relationships between tables.
