## MVC
well today was a mess ðŸ¥²

this is what a good procedure should be like

controller -> handels client request and req uses service and class

service -> handels the business logic that is get data from db put to db and all those things only this guy should do, we ise ORM to map

model -> blueprint for the table we use JPA to map


## lets go further

declare a interace for services and handle define all CRUD basic why?? lets say we change from one DB to another well the model structure would be the same but the methods name we should make it resuable la so only

wait dont we have ORM to handle it? well there is nothing wrong in handling it and lets say we switch to NoSQL what then?? aa

well will it work!! lets practice it tomorrow
